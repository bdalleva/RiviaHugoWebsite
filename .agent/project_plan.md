🏗️ Project Plan: Rivia Inc. Official Website

Brand Positioning: Senior Backend & Cloud Architecture Consultancy.
Core Tech: Hugo (SSG) + Tailwind CSS + GitHub Actions (CI/CD).
Phase 1: Design System & Visual Identity

Goal: Establish a "Senior Engineer" aesthetic that commands authority.

    Step 1.1: Design Tokens: Define a tailwind.config.js using a "Midnight Professional" palette:

        Background: #0B0E14 (Deep Obsidian).

        Accents: #00D2FF (Electric Blue) and #10B981 (Success Green).

        Type: Inter (Body) and JetBrains Mono (Technical/Headers).

    Step 1.2: Global Layouts: Build the Base OF (Head, Footer, Navbar) with a minimalist, high-contrast look.

    Step 1.3: Hero Section: Create a high-impact "Above the Fold" area featuring:

        Headline: "Enterprise-Grade Backend Architecture. Built by a Solo Specialist."

        Sub-headline: Focusing on .NET 8/9, Azure/AWS, and high-performance C# systems.

        Social Proof: Badges for C#, Cloud certifications, or tech logos.

Phase 2: Service Architecture & Content Modeling

Goal: Clearly define what Rivia Inc. sells to reduce "scope creep" later.

    Step 2.1: The Service Matrix: Create three primary landing cards:

        Cloud-Native Modernization: (Azure/AWS migrations, Serverless).

        C# Backend Engineering: (High-performance APIs, Distributed Systems).

        Security & DevOps: (Transitioning from your cybersecurity interest—OWASP, CI/CD hardening).

    Step 2.2: The "Lone Dev" Value Prop: A dedicated section explaining the benefits of hiring a solo expert (Speed, Zero Overhead, Direct Communication).

    Step 2.3: Tech Stack Grid: An interactive icon grid showcasing your mastery (C#, .NET, Linux, PostgreSQL, Docker, etc.).

Phase 3: The Showcase (Flagship Project Integration)

Goal: Create the "home" for your custom CMS/CRM project.

    Step 3.1: Project Template: Create a custom Hugo layout for projects/.

    Step 3.2: The CMS Deep Dive: A dedicated page for your upcoming CMS project featuring:

        Architecture diagrams (Mermaid.js).

        Code snippets highlighting clean architecture.

        The "Problem solved" (e.g., "Why I built a .NET alternative to slow CRMs").

Phase 4: Lead Conversion & Logistics

Goal: Make it effortless for a client to pay or book you.

    Step 4.1: Booking Engine: Embed a Calendly widget or a custom form with high-intent fields (Budget, Timeline, Tech Stack).

    Step 4.2: SEO & Speed Audit:

        Generate a dynamic Sitemap and robots.txt.

        Optimize images for WebP.

        Ensure a 100/100 Lighthouse score.

    Step 4.3: Location Optimization: Strategic mention of Huntington, NY/Long Island to capture local Tri-state area search traffic.

Phase 5: Deployment & CI/CD

Goal: Automation so you never manually upload files.

    Step 5.1: Repository Setup: Configure GitHub Actions to auto-build the Hugo site on every git push.

    Step 5.2: Production Hosting: Deploy to a custom domain (e.g., rivia.inc or riviaconsulting.com) via GitHub Pages or Netlify.
